Nowadays, everyone is getting busier with a lot of things to do. In fact, we are living in a world
filled with too much distractions and plenty of shiny things that usually lead us off course of what
we are trying to do. Moreover, having multiple things due on a single day can make it really difficult
to manage deadlines. Therefore, having a to-do list is not only productive, but also a savior in some
circumstances. A lot of people would write their tasks down in their notebook or use an application for managing
their schedule. The written approach is commonly used by people who do not prefer technology
over writing, or maybe they want to keep their list as a completely separate entity. The drawback
with this approach is they would require to constantly check their notebook to get reminded. A
To-Do list application would help them manage their tasks in a much more organized manner, with
the additional advantage of getting reminders.
